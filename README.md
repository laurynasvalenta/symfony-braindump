# Symfony Braindump

## Introduction

This repository is created as a preparation for the Symfony 7 Certification. It is a personal project that comes with no guarantees.

## Structure

This repository contains these main sections:

* Analysis of [the official Symfony Certification topics](https://certification.symfony.com/exams/symfony.html) declared by the Symfony.
* Set of lists that must be memorized by heart.

Every exam topic (or Symfony component) is analysed by following this structure:

1. Relevant documentation pages are linked in the text. 
2. Key concepts (e.g. Cache Adapters, Form Types, Validator Constraints) are identified, their parts are listed.
3. The following standard lists are created:
   * Symfony Events
   * Symfony Attributes
   * Constants
   * Interfaces
